<h2>
<a id="normal-mode" class="anchor" href="#normal-mode" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Normal Mode</h2>

<p>Create a Django project for a bookmarking site. Users can save URLs with
a title and an optional description.</p>

<p>Each bookmark should have a unique code -- something like "x1yrd3a" -- for use
in looking it up later. Create a route like "/b/{code}" that will redirect any
user -- not just logged in users -- to the bookmark associated with that code.
The route does not have to look just like the example.</p>

<p>When a user -- anonymous or logged in -- uses a bookmark URL, record that user,
bookmark, and timestamp. A suggested name for this model is Click, even though
you can navigate to the URL without a click by entering it in your navigation
bar.</p>

<p>The site should have user registration, login, and logout.</p>

<p>On a logged in user's index page, they should see a list of the bookmarks
they've saved in reverse chronological order, paginated. The bookmark links
should use the internal short-code route, not the original URL. From this page,
they should be able to edit and delete bookmarks.</p>

<p>A user's bookmark page should be public. When viewing a user's bookmark page
when not that user, the links to edit and delete bookmarks should not show up.</p>

<p>There should also be a page to view all bookmarks for all users in reverse
chronological order, paginated.</p>

<p>These features are restated in the following list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users can create an account, log in, and log out.</li>
<li>Users can save a URL as a bookmark with a title and an optional description.</li>
<li>Users can see all their bookmarks in a paginated list in reverse chronological order.</li>
<li>Users can edit and delete their own bookmarks.</li>
<li>Users can see all the bookmarks for another user in a paginated list in reverse chronological order.</li>
<li>Users can see all the bookmarks for all users in a paginated list in reverse chronological order.</li>
<li>Users can access a bookmark through a URL with a short code, allowing them to share bookmarks.</li>
<li>When a user accesses a bookmark, the access is recorded with the bookmark, the user -- or anonymous user -- and the timestamp.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have all these features, you will need to generate a good amount of
click data. Create fake data for this. Numpy and Faker are useful libraries for
creating your fake data.</p>

<p>Add a stats page for each link where you can see the traffic for that link for the last 30 days in a line chart.</p>

<p>Add an overall stats page for each user where you can see a table of their links by popularity and their number
of clicks over the last 30 days. This page should only be visible to that user.</p>

<h2>
<a id="hard-mode" class="anchor" href="#hard-mode" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hard Mode</h2>

<p>For hard mode, do everything shown above, plus any of the following features.</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow users to create topical lists of URLs, with each list having a title and
optional description.</li>
<li>Allow resorting of URLs on topical list pages.</li>
<li>Allow users to add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)">tags</a> to their URLs and have pages for each user + tag combo, as well as overall tag pages.</li>
<li>On individual link stats pages, make a table of where the clicks for your links are coming from by country. Bonus -- display this on a map.</li>
<li>Add an option to the individual and group stats pages where you can see stats for the last week, last 30 days, last year, or all time.</li>
<li>Add functional tests for all your pages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="additional-resources" class="anchor" href="#additional-resources" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Additional Resources</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://hashids.org/python/">Hashids</a>. These may be useful for creating short URLs.</li>
</ul>
